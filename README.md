# Doggy Directory

## A directory used to store doggy data!

I created this project to better my understanding of react & express. This is the back end to the project. Here I focused on learning how express routing works, handing user requests to dynamic routes, and utilizing node's file system controls to perform CRUD operations on JSON data.
